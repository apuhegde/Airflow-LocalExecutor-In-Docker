# Run Airflow via Docker on local machine using LocalExecutor

This project is a use case for running Airflow using LocalExecutor in a Docker container. The goal of the project is to analyze data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission website. For now, I've only worked on the Airflow pipeline portion, the analysis will follow eventually.

A lot of the original code has been used from the Data Engineering Zoomcamp course on GitHub [https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

Step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the Airflow LocalExecutor pipeline can be found in the Wiki [https://github.com/apuhegde/Airflow-LocalExecutor-In-Docker/wiki/Run-Airflow-via-Docker-on-local-machine](https://github.com/apuhegde/Airflow-LocalExecutor-In-Docker/wiki/Run-Airflow-via-Docker-on-local-machine). Basic bash scripting and python programming knowledge is required.
